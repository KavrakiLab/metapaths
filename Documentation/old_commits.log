    Added functionality for viewing a single path at a time. Can filter down the total paths, then view each single path sequentially. The tooltips will display different info for the single paths, implemented, needs content. Added dynamic alteration of html depending of if we're view all paths, or just a single path.

    Integreated the nodesMap into the front end. It will be use for filtering (working on currently) and edge/node weights (near future). 'filter.js' will no longer be used, all filtering is now in the same script, 'allGraphs.js'. In the middle of reimplementing filtering, unfinished. Continue from line 460 in 'allGraphs.js'
